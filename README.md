# [VXGI](https://developer.nvidia.com/vxgi) - Voxel Global Ilumination

[VXGI](https://developer.nvidia.com/vxgi) is a new way, developed by NVIDIA, to simulate Global Illumination. The [NVIDIA's](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) implementation converts the 3D scene into voxels.

Our main goals were:
* Learn how [VXGI](https://developer.nvidia.com/vxgi) works;
* Create a [website](http://machinezero.github.io/)  with some documentation and explanation of [NVIDIA's](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) code, due to the lack of documentation;
* Imporve the [demo](https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload#?dn=nvidia-vxgi-0-9) from [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us);
* Test the scalability of [VXGI](https://developer.nvidia.com/vxgi) by testing with larger scenes than [Sponza](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml) model, like [Ponte De Lima](http://www4.di.uminho.pt/pl3d/) and [Rungholt](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml)

[Here](http://machinezero.github.io/) you can see everything that we learned and created about [Voxel Global Ilumination](https://developer.nvidia.com/vxgi)
